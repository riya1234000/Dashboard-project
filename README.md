## 📊 Excel Dashboard Project: Dynamic Business Insights
Welcome to my Excel Dashboard project — a fully interactive, filter-driven analytics tool built to transform raw Call Centre data into clear, actionable insights. This project demonstrates my ability to automate reporting, apply formulas, and design clean, user-friendly dashboards using Excel.

## Project Overview
This dashboard allows users to analyze Call Centre performance across multiple dimensions in Table 1:-  such as Call number, Customer_ID, Duration, Representation, Date_of_call, Purchase Amount, FY, Day_of_week, Duration Busket, Rating Rounded. In Table 2:- Customer_ID, Gender, Age, City. It uses dropdown filters, dynamic summary tables, and responsive charts to deliver real-time insights in 2023.
