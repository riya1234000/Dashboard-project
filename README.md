📊 Excel Dashboard Project: Dynamic Business Insights
Welcome to my Excel Dashboard project — a fully interactive, filter-driven analytics tool built to transform raw Call Centre data into clear, actionable insights. This project demonstrates my ability to automate reporting, apply formulas, and design clean, user-friendly dashboards using Excel.

In Table 2:- Customer_ID, Gender, Age, City. It uses dropdown filters, dynamic summary tables, and responsive charts to deliver real-time insights in 2023.
